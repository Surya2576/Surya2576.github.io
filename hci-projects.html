        <h2>Project 2: TravelBuddy</h2>
        <p>This project focuses on developing TravelBuddy, a voice agent/chatbot designed to facilitate hospitality services. The goal was to alleviate the stress of planning trips, especially for students.</p>
        
        <h3>Empathize</h3>
        <p>The focus was narrowed down to one sector of hospitality, utilizing mind-mapping structures to identify use-cases and potential stakeholders. An online survey was created to gather insights:</p>
        <h4>Mind Map</h4>
        <img src="images/mindmap_2.png" alt="Mind Map for Ideas">
        <p>Here is the mind map that illustrates the various ideas generated during our brainstorming sessions. It served as a foundational tool for understanding user needs.</p>
        
        <h4>User Survey Results</h4>
        <img src="images/survey_2.png" alt="User Survey Results">
        <p>The user survey results are shown above. These insights were critical in identifying common challenges faced by travelers.</p>
        
        <p>Common challenges faced during travel include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Language Barriers</li>
          <li>Finding Reliable Information</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h3>User Interview Insights</h3>
        <p>An interview with an exchange student provided personal insights. Key takeaways include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Users prefer spontaneity for short trips but need itineraries for longer travels.</li>
          <li>Last-minute itinerary problems are manageable for spontaneous travelers.</li>
          <li>Depth of research varies by trip type; users may not feel they miss attractions they weren't aware of.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Identified User Behaviors and Bottlenecks</h3>
        <p>Research revealed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Users tend to prefer minimal effort for maximum benefits.</li>
          <li>Budget constraints are crucial for maximizing enjoyment.</li>
          <li>Many users lack knowledge about international destinations.</li>
          <li>Budget planning is cumbersome due to unpredictable costs.</li>
          <li>Finding reliable information is often difficult and time-consuming.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Our Solution</h3>
        <p>An AI agent was proposed to allow users to plan trip itineraries effortlessly, addressing the identified needs and challenges.</p>

        <h3>POVs (Points of View)</h3>
        <p>Personas representing target users were constructed to guide the design process:</p>

        <h3>Prototyping Process</h3>
        <p>Low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes were developed using tools like Figma and Next.js, incorporating user feedback from surveys and interviews.</p>

        <h3>Heuristic Analysis</h3>
        <p>A heuristic analysis was conducted to identify usability issues:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Inconsistent UI elements.</li>
          <li>Lack of icons for better mapping.</li>
          <li>No clear "Submit" button leading to confusion.</li>
          <li>Insufficient feedback during signup.</li>
          <li>Content overflow in input boxes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
        <p>Utilizing "Conceptual Model Extraction" as the testing protocol allowed users to articulate their thought processes while using the app. Findings included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Users tended to write short descriptions, indicating a need for clearer instructions.</li>
          <li>Navigating back to the home page was not intuitive.</li>
          <li>Longer inputs overflowed, indicating the need for better input management.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>My Contributions</h3>
        <p>Responsibilities included creating the Google Forms survey, developing the HTA and GOMS flow diagrams, and understanding user interactions to improve the design.</p>
